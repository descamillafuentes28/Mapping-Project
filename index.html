<p>Once a year, an Environmental Health Specialist, commonly known as an inspector, will visit a restaurant.</p>

<p>According to Daniela Garcia Peña, kitchen supervisor at Jose Andres Catering Group, the meticulous inspector can take up to an hour making sure the restaurant is up to code, while the less-rigorous inspector can be done in 20 minutes.</p>

<p>In 2023, in New York City, the most common violation found according to NYC Open Data was “non-food contact surface or equipment made of unacceptable material, not kept clean, or properly sealed, raised, spaced or movable to allow accessibility for cleaning on all sides, above and underneath the unit.” And the second most common violation was “establishment is not free of harborage or conditions conducive to rodents, insects or other pests.” In the Bronx, 1,185 out of its 18,523 restaurants had violations, making it the borough with the most restaurant violations.</p> 

<p>A Texas Environmental Health Specialist, Lo Johnson says that “the benefits of having an inspection is educating the owner, management, and food handling employees of the safety guidelines that are required from the state.” When restaurants cooperate, inspections can be an easy and smooth process.</p>

<p>“I don’t like when someone attempts to use their power, money, or tenure in their business to try to sway me to give them the score or citation that they earned,” says Johnson.<p>

<p>For Johnson and Peña, taking into account a restaurant’s grade is a determining factor if they will eat there or not.<p>
